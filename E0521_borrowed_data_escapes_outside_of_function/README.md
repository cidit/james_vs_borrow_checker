Here the error reference doesn't much help:
https://doc.rust-lang.org/error_codes/E0521.html
"A type annotation of a closure parameter implies a new lifetime declaration. Consider to drop it, the compiler is reliably able to infer them."
Does not seem to be my problem here

Firstly I started making the tree owned, which lead me to

"[E0507]: cannot move out of `branch`, a captured variable in an `Fn` closure".
I found my way to:
https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch13-01-closures.html#closure-type-inference-and-annotation
It slowly dawned on me that the type of the closure was `Fn` which would mean that the move was 
not allowed, because if the closure can run more than once, after the first time, the value has 
already been moved. It would have to be a `FnOnce` type closure to allow that, but the specified 
type is `Fn`.

So I would have to build the display only once and just switch the displayed view/layer/screen on 
the event

[src/bin/solution_move.rs]() is a "solution" that accomplishes this functionality, but it does mean 
that the whole view tree is built at once, rather than building a view when it is required. And 
everything gets moved all over the place, rather than referenced, so not Rusty at all. Yeuch!

Cursive has a user_data member which I hope can be used to accomplish this without unnecessary moves
